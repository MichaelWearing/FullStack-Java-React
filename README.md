# FullStack-Java-React

A fullstack app with basic functionality to create and view students.

Front End - React
Backend - Java
Database - Postgres

----- Next steps -----

--- General ---

- Dockerize and run in Kubernetes

--- Front end ---

Current:
- Confirm that passwords match

ToDo:
- Don't allow login when failed authentication
- Display user logged in
- Keep user logged in on reload using cookies
- Refresh should not log a user out (use cookies)
- Email or password being inncorect should be communicated
- Wipe user info after a user is created?
- Maybe look into design
- Confirm that it is a valid email

--- Back end ---

- Handle failed Auth better
- Look into how status codes work in Springboot
